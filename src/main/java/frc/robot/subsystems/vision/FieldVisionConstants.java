  // Notes about robot to camera transforms
  // 1. These are not used for Limelight; instead you configure it in web UI. However, we
  //    include transforms even for Limelight because they are used by simulation.
  //
  // 2. Pay attention to the signs of the camera rotation because they are not intuitive,
  //    especially the pitch. You would think that a camera pointed down to the floor
  //    would have a negative pitch but actually it should be positive. All the angles use
  //    the right-hand rule: point the thumb on your right hand in the positive direction
  //    of the axis you are going to rotate about. Then your finger curl in the positive
  //    direction of rotation. The convention is that the x-axis is positive toward the
  //    front of the robot, y-axis is positive toward the left of the robot; z-axis is
  //    positive vertically up. So pitch is a rotation about y-axis so point your right
  //    thumb toward the left of the robot and you will see that curling your fingers
  //    will tilt the front of the robot down.
